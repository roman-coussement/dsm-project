# Data Science Modelling Project
## Overview
As part of an undergraduate module, I was assigned this as a personal project. The task was take one of a selection of provided datasets, formulate a research question based on the data, and produce a 2,000 word research paper on the topic.    
This paper had to contain the following elements:
* An unsupervised learning technique
* A supervised learning technique
* A resampling method
Of which, the chosen methods were:
* Principal components analysis (PCA)
* Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)
* K-fold cross validation

## Results
The result is a 2,000 word research paper that highlights the mixed results/effectiveness of the resulting model, with some suggestions for areas of improvement. This report is given in the PDF document above, titled *dsm-project.pdf*
